/** video 11 : Autocomplete Widget Fragment **/
// The autocomplete service in the Places SDK for Android returns place predictions in response
// to user search queries. As the user types, the autocomplete service returns suggestions
// for places such as businesses, addresses, plus codes, and points of interest.
//
// You can add autocomplete to your app in the following ways:
// - Add an autocomplete widget to save development time and ensure a consistent user experience.
// - Get place predictions programmatically to create a customized user experience.
